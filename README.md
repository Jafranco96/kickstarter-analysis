# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
---
An aspiring playwright, Louise, utilized the crowdfunding source of Kickstarter to attempt to raise over $10,000 to finance her latest play. While her crowdfunding campaign was fairly successful, having come close to raising its full fundraising goal in just a short amount of time, Louise is interested seeing in how other Kickstarter campaigns similar to hers fared based on their different launch dates and fundraising goals. Where these campaigns more successful? Less successful? These are the questions Louise is interested in. By utilizing data analysis and visualizations, these questions will be answered and Louise will know what new adjustments to make to ensure more successful Kickstarter campaigns in the future.
